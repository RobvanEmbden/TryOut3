        <h1 class="title">The story about Johan Cruyff</h1>
        <p>
          Johan Cruyff, was a Dutch professional football player and coach. As a
          player, he won the Ballon d'Or three times, in 1971, 1973, and 1974.
        </p>
        <p>
          Cruyff was a proponent of the football philosophy known as Total
          Football explored by Rinus Michels, and is widely regarded as one of
          the greatest players in football history.In the late 1960s and early
          1970s, Dutch football rose from obscurity to become a powerhouse in
          the sport.Cruyff led the Netherlands to the final of the 1974 FIFA
          World Cup and received the Golden Ball as player of the tournament.

          At the 1974 finals, he executed a feint that subsequently was named
          after him, the "Cruyff Turn", a move widely replicated in the modern
          game. Wearing the number 14 jersey, he set a trend for wearing shirt
          numbers outside the usual starting line-up numbers of one to eleven.

          After finishing third in UEFA Euro 1976, Cruyff refused to play in the
          1978 World Cup in protest of Argentine dictator Jorge Videla. At club
          level, Cruyff started his career at Ajax, where he won eight
          Eredivisie titles, three European Cups, and one Intercontinental Cup.
          In 1973, he moved to Barcelona for a world record transfer fee,
          helping the team win La Liga in his first season, and was named
          European Footballer of the Year. After retiring from playing in 1984,
          Cruyff became highly successful as manager of Ajax and later
          Barcelona; he remained an influential advisor to both clubs after his
          coaching tenures His son Jordi also played football professionally..
          In 1999,
        </p>
        <p>
          Cruyff was voted European Player of the Century in an election held by
          the International Federation of Football History & Statistics, and
          came second behind Pelé in their World Player of the Century poll. He
          came third in a vote organised by the French magazine France Football
          consulting their former Ballon d'Or winners to elect their Football
          Player of the Century. He was included in the World Team of the 20th
          Century in 1998, the FIFA World Cup Dream Team in 2002, and in 2004
          was named in the FIFA 100 list of the world's greatest living
          players..

          influential figures in football history, Cruyff's style of play and
          football philosophy has influenced managers and players alike,
          including Arrigo Sacchi, Alex Ferguson, Arsène Wenger, Quique Setién,
          Judan Ali, Carlo Ancelotti, Lucien Favre, Luis Enrique, Roberto
          Martínez, Pep Guardiola, Frank Rijkaard, Michael Laudrup, Eric
          Cantona, Peter Bosz, Marcelo Bielsa, Manuel Pellegrini, Mauricio
          Pochettino, and Unai Emery.. Ajax and Barcelona are among the clubs
          that have developed youth academies based on Cruyff's coaching
          methods. His coaching philosophy helped lay the foundations for the
          revival of Ajax's international successes in the 1990s, and Spanish
          football's successes at both club and international levels during the
          years 2008 to 2012 have been cited as evidence of Cruyff's impact on
