          During a 50-year project in the 17th century Amsterdam grew to four
          times its previous size, becoming the 3rd largest city in the world
          after London and Paris. Central to that plan was the Canal Belt, a
          network of concentric canals that is now UNESCO listed. Built on
          reclaimed land, Amsterdam is a feat of ingenuity, and still crackles
          with the ambition, cultural tolerance and enterprise that drove the
          17th-century Golden Age when the Netherlands led the world in trade,
          maritime power, culture and economic might. This is the city of
          Rembrandt, Anne Frank, the Red Light District, Johan Cruyff, and the
          Dutch East and West India Companies; there’s a world of fascinating
          stories, spellbinding art and architecture that has stood the test of
          time.

          Steeped in its evocative history and the rapid changes that have taken
          place over the past two decades, Berlin today exerts its own
          particular fascination. More than twenty years after the fall of the
          Berlin Wall and the reunification of Germany, the capital projects
          itself as a young, dynamic and cosmopolitan city at the heart of
          Europe which is constantly re-inventing itself. Variety is guaranteed,
          but you can also travel to the German capital for rest and relaxation.

          which improves the quality of living and allows visitors to take a
          short break.

          <h3>Madrid is an open-minded</h3>city where culture and entertainment share a
          thriving space. Thanks to its modern and cosmopolitan flare and to the
          friendly and passionate character of madrileños, the Spanish capital
          makes everyone feel right at home while providing them with some of
          the world’s most interesting tourist attractions.
        </p>
        <p>
          Over eighty museums and more than two thousand monuments -both
          historical and artistic-, contribute to the city’s richness, a
          cultural heritage without which it would be impossible to understand
          European and world history.

         <h3>Rome was called the “Eternal City”</h3> by the ancient Romans because they
          believed that no matter what happened in the rest of the world, the
          city of Rome would always remain standing. Exploring the city centre
          by foot surrounded by glorious monuments and colossal remains takes
          you back in time to the “glory that was Rome”.

          With its unparalleled history, Rome is the third most visited city in
          Europe and the fourteenth worldwide. It attracts visitors from all
          over the world who are impatient to discover the city’s impressive
          monuments and archaeological sites; not to mention its renowned
          cuisine and its lively atmosphere.

          When exploring the Colosseum, visitors will easily imagine how the
          gladiators fought for their life in the arena, cheered by the crowd.
          In the Circus Maximus, travelers will picture the chariots crashing
          into each other in order to be first in the race, and in the Roman
          Forum visualise what the Roman public life was like.
